				<div class="grid_6 indexp omega"><p>I am a nerd. I thoroughly enjoy writing, editing, and learning the latest best practices. I even volunteered to edit friends' papers, and created resumes for two of my friends when I was in college. I get abnormally excited to find the perfect verb or craft the perfect paragraph, and I live for audience awareness.</p>

				<div class="grid_6 indexp omega"><p>In December of 2014, I graduated from Eastern Washington Uuniversity with a degree in Technical Communication. From this degree, I now know how to write a convincing proposal, craft a proper press release, and create a mean infographic. A few months after returning to my hometown of the notoriously rainy city of Seattle, I was offered a position on NTSI's marketing team. Since starting this job, I have spent my days writing, editing, designing, and learning about SEO. I'm excited for all that I will learn in this position, and I'm thrilled to be applying my experience and skills in the real world!</p>
